## Introduction {#mrt-intro}

Inherently low soil fertility, nutrient imbalances and potentially accelerating soil physical, chemical and biological degradation, are thought to constitute threats to maintaining agricultural productivity and other ecosystem services across Africa's cropland biome. However, at present the geographical extent of existing soil problems in croplands, their location specific trends and opportunities for managing these over time are not known. Some of the key information gaps include:

* The cropland area and the proportion of arable land that is being used for cultivation has not been adequately identified with sufficient accuracy to allow spatial targeting of appropriate management practices. 
* Rapidly growing populations in Africa (currently estimated at ~ ?? M, and projected to ~?? M by 2030) will require substantial increases in either agricultural productivity per unit of currently cultivated land area and/or the expansion of cultivated lands to meet food demands.
* The rate of yield increases in staple cereal crops (e.g., maize, sorghum, rice and other field crops) may be slowing and various soil constraints appear to be one important factor influencing this trend. However, the spatial distribution of these constraints is not known and it is therefore difficult to devise location specific nutrient input and crop management recommendations. 
* Economically viable and ecologically sustainable nutrient input/import options have not been previously established at sub-national scales or for specific agro-ecologies and landuse systems. As a consequence, blanket fertilizer formulations and other agro-input recommendations are being blindly applied countrywide.
* Soil degradation reduces agricultural productivity and other ecosystem service deliveries to people. However, the geographical distribution, rates and impacts of important soil degradation processes (e.g. wind and water erosion, organic matter and nutrient depletion, acidification, salinization, alkalization, compaction, loss of below ground biodiversity) are poorly documented and understood. 
* Water-use efficiency in crop and rangeland production systems is determined in part by soil management. Again, the actual and potential water use efficiencies of agricultural systems in Africa (and elsewhere) are poorly characterized and should be assessed to evaluate e.g. the potential tradeoffâ€™s between needs for agricultural production and the availability of potable water for rapidly growing human populations.
* Changing climatic conditions may increasingly disrupt current land use systems. The sustainability of these systems will depend on interactions between climate, soil, and land management as well as by the policies that enable or undermine them. 

An ability to track these potential changes and anticipate the attendant consequences requires reliable information about the characteristics and distribution of cropland productivity and the potentials for improvement, given interventions. One of the most reliable and informative ways of monitoring both the current situation and the potentials is by using [**Randomized Controlled Trials**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial) (RCT). However, the main problems with all RCTs is that they are usually logistically difficult and quite expensive to conduct.
