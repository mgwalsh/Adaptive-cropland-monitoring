# Introduction {#introduction}

The dynamics of terrestrial landscapes and ecosystems, including the ones dominated by humans and their endeavors, are ultimately controlled by factors that are both external and internal to those systems. The **external factors**, or the so-called *"state factors of soil and ecosystem formation"*, control overall, long-term (inter-generational) landscape and ecosystem dynamics and the way things work within the associated geographies and geo-physical boundaries (Jenny 1941, 1961, 1994).

Climate delineates the biomes in which landscapes and ecosystems are embedded. Long-term average rainfall patterns and seasonal temperatures broadly influence the rates geo-physical processes at the soil surface which determine the flux potentials of water, nutrients and energy that are available to plants and animals in a landscape. Parent materials determine the nature and composition of soils, and strongly influence the supplies of mineral nutrients and soil physical properties (e.g., texture and metal oxide compositions). Topography influences landscape primary and secondary production processes by affecting microclimate, the rates of soil development, weathering rates, erosion/ablation and the overall movement of water and soluble nutrients through the system. The potential biota factor governs the type and diversity of organisms that actually/currently occupy landscapes and ecosystems. The time state factor (or perhaps more appropriately *entropy*) influences everything. Whereas, external factors are said to operate everywhere (on Earth's *terra firma*), the **internal factors** are more localized, contingent and potentially much faster-acting (Walker et al. 2012).

Unlike the external factors, the internal factors do not only control landscape and ecosystem processes such as net primary and secondary productivity, soil carbon and nitrogen fixation and landcover change but are also controlled by them *inter alia*. They are contingent on the external factors and are often subject to relatively fast feedback loops that either accellerate and/or balance the otherwise seemingly equilibrial external processes over human generational time-scales. For example, while water, nutrient and energy inputs and cyclying are controlled everywhere by the external processes the utilization and dynamics of the resulting *"flux potentials"* within ecosystems (*sensu* Jenny 1964) are also controlled by numerous additional internal factors such as: phenology, decomposition, root competition and canopy shading, fire and other disturbances, the occurrence and distributions of pollinators, invasive species, pests and diseases, predation rates, soil condition, water and air pollution, among many others. Other anthropically controllable factors like the types of species that are currently present and/or anthropically favored in a landscape are also internal factors. 

As the human communities and per capita consumption grow exponentially, so do the resource demands imposed on their constituent landscapes and ecosystems. These affect both the human ecological footprint (see @: [**Ecological Footprint**](https://www.footprintnetwork.org/our-work/ecological-footprint/)) and the geographical extent of its associated biome. Food production systems appear to be increasingly vulnerable, and the socio-ecological, public-health and environmental impacts of our anthropogenic legacies are becoming increasingly apparent (cite). Resource aquisition conflicts increasingly appear to drive our global economies, politics, trade agreements and survival strategies at an accelerated pace (cite).

Current problems in all human dominated landscapes and ecosystems include: stagnant or decreasing primary productivity relative to increasing food production demands, soil, water and air pollution, climate change, emergent diseases, invasive species and biodiversity losses, which are all significant *"latent functions"* (sensu Merton, 1936) of generally *"well intentioned"* management interventions. The long-term, unforeseen side-effects tend to negate and complicate those well intentioned management efforts, which are frequently counteracted by a reinforcing loop (positive) feedback cycle that requires increasingly more interventions over time. We denote these types of system dynamics as *"fixes that fail systems"* (cite).

## General dynamics of systems with "fixes that fail" {#fixes-that-fail}

The current developed country agricultural paradigm is to manage agricultultural productivity and production is based on perceived productivity/production gaps. The main idea is that if and when the perceived production gaps are large relative to what is economically desired, fixes like input subsidies, genomic technologies and agronomic management reccomendations will be implemented to remedy/close those perceived gaps. The basic dynamics of this type of thinking are shown in (Fig. \@ref(fig:current_balancing_approach)).

```{r current_balancing_approach, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Current paradigm for yield/production fix dynamics.", out.width = '60%', }
knitr::include_graphics("figures/current_balancing_loop.png")
```

While this sort of strategy is not a completely terrible idea that has served agricultural production well under many circumstances, there are always the (potentially) long-term, unintended side-effects that should be considered and weighed appropriately. In medical practice considering long-term side-effects is now standard practice, but in natural resource management it is still quite rare for land managers to consider long-term side effects i.e., those beyond their own lifetimes. The FTF dynamics, which may ensue are shown in (Fig. fig:\@ref(FTF))

```{r FTF, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Managing production gaps with potentially counter productive side-effects.", out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FTF_loop.png")
```

**Fixes That Fail (FTF) systems** are a classic construct that is used in system dynamics to describe and analyze a situation where a “fix” that may be effective in the short-term creates detrimental side effects for the longer-term dynamics of the system. These can result in a perceived need for even more management fixes. FTF systems have common characteristics and dynamics that have been demonstrated over a wide range of human endeavors and geographies. FTF systems share the following general charateristics:

* They initially operate in a standard *“balancing loop”* fashion". However, the management actions that change the current state toward the desired state also influence some *"side-effects"* e.g., soil erosion, acidification, saliniztion, nutrient and/or organic matter depletion. The side-effects subsequently impede reaching the desired ecological state and/or production goal.
* FTF dynamics are difficult to manage because of the potential time delays associated with the side-effects and fluctuations in the production environment. It is therefore difficult to observe and measure what is happening.
* FTF structures are often part of more elaborate structures in which managers and policy makers are dealing with symptoms rather than with the underlying problem(s). They also often become dependent on fixes, applying them over and over, and expecting different results.
* FTF dynamical structures also underpin related system archetypes wherein cooperative influences in institutions are unintentionally responsible for creating problems for the involved parties. For additional insights into this phenomenon see e.g.: [**Accidental Adversaries**](https://thesystemsthinker.com/accidental-adversaries-when-friends-become-foes/).

While the last point may appear to be a complete aside, it is also real human force in hindering development progress in Africa and its global markets for food. Much like during the *"Scramble for Africa"* (cite), which occurred between 1881-1914, nations are now still in a more-or-less "friendly" competition to improve living conditions for African smallholder farmers. The problem is that those nations and their development institutions can, and probably have, become accidental adversaries, just because of the underlying dynamical systems that are driven by misunderstandings and often by only partial knowledge of what the facts or development needs really are. In turn these conflicts currently shape African economies and socio-ecological systems.

## Adaptive management of landscapes {#adaptive-management}

Adaptive management (AM) is *“Natural Resource Management"* conducted in a manner that purposely and explicitly aims at increasing knowledge and reducing uncertainty” (Holling 1978, Walters 1986). AM is particularly useful, and currently probably the only effective means, for managing FTF-type systems because of the uncertainties and complex long-term dynamics inherent in these. Adaptive management is data intensive because there is *"reinforcement learning (RL)"* involved. RL is how we and other species learn to walk. The approach seems to work well, also in contexts other than just walking and particularly for machine-learning. Note that an average farmer in Africa will have ~25-30 years to learn how to get both the farming business bits as well as their potential side effects right. Our effort here is dedicated to support and accelerate the related reinforcement learning processes without harming future generations ... do no harm!

Adaptive assessment (AA) “tries to define what is known and what is not known about various adaptive management issues and how these evolve over time and space” (Holling 1978). It is corollary and antecedent to AM and attempts to make explicit the assumptions underlying management actions. AM actions can then be structured and validated to test those assumptions, while solving specific AM issues. By doing so, AA attempts to continually fill the gap between knowledge and action. In the cropland management context, rather than focusing on the rather narrow and short-term goal of optimizing for a perceived production gap, AA assesses social-ecological state variables more broadly and attempts to anticipate the evolution of significant side effects as well as changes in production environments and their socio-ecological contexts.

## What this book is about {#about}

This book is about the processes for producing and using (useful) data, information and algoritms for adaptive management via adaptive assessment workflows. We now have many new tools, including high-resolution satellite observations, telcom-based data collection and transmission tools and low cost laboratory and data analysis techniques, which we did not have available 10 years ago. The book provides introductions to the new assessment techniques that use those technolgies. In most of the ensuing chapters real, generally live datasets from Africa are used to demonstrate how these may be used for adaptive assessment, monitoring and management in real landscapes. We also adhere to what we believe to be completely *"Findable-Accessible-Interoperable-Reuseable"* [**FAIR**](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data and code principles, which are rapidly becoming an international standard that we support entusiastically. All of the associated workflows are implemented and referenced in [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/), and we gratefully acknowledge the R user community for doing all of the hard work that makes our lives and teaching efforts so much more possible.
